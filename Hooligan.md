## Hooligan CTF

**Rules/Thing to know for Hooligan**


* You may not use google/stackoverflow/anything. everything you need can either be found on this document, or in a manpage. plus you won't find the answers online. 

* you may not activley sabotage another players game. I've tried to make the game solid, but there will be things that I missed.

* Sharing passwords is strictly forbidden and will be punished by death (or disqualification) 


* Cheating (outside of the preceeding rules) is heavily encouraged. Please try and break the game (but preferably not the server it's on)

* You will want to keep a document with all the passwords you've found. It'll come in handy

* There is a logbook on every level. feel free to add your name or some trash talk, but please don't mess with it too much

* good luck

* you can use ``su - <username>`` to switch users.
