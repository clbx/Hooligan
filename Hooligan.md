## Hooligan CTF

**Rules/Thing to know for Hooligan**

- You may not use google/stackoverflow/anything. Everything you need can either be found on this document, the cheatshee, or in a manpage. Plus you won't find the answers online. 
- you may not activley sabotage another players game. I've tried to make the game solid, but there will be things that I missed.
- Sharing passwords is strictly forbidden and will be punished by death (or disqualification) 

- Cheating (outside of the preceeding rules) is heavily encouraged. Please try and break the game (but preferably not the server it's on)
- You will want to keep a document with all the passwords you've found. It'll come in handy
- There is a logbook on every level. feel free to add your name or some trash talk, but please don't mess with it too much
- all passwords are human readable and are generally one word all lowercase and at least 5 characters long.
- you can create a folder in /tmp/ for temporary work, tmp is the only user modifiable directory, /tmp/ is not listable. 
- you can use ``su - <username>`` to switch users.
- Please be patient with any errors
