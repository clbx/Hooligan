Hooligan CTF (aka baby's first CTF)

Hooligan CTF is loosly modeled after Over the Wire's Bandit CTF. This is made to be a bit easier and for people who haven't had much experience with the linux commandline to sink their teeth into it.

Hooligan was made for the E-Town CS club, by Clay Buxton (@clbx) and Mark Gross (@MarkusGordathian)
