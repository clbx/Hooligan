# Hooligan

Hooligan CTF (aka baby's first CTF)

Hooligan CTF is loosly modeled after Over the Wire's Bandit CTF. This is made to be a bit easier and for people who haven't had much experience with the linux commandline to sink their teeth into it.

Hooligan was made for the E-Town CS club. 

Hooligan has 35 levels, each getting progressivley harder. An experienced linux user should be able to get through all 50 in about an hour or so. A newbie might take a little longer. The levels are sectioned as follows:

Hooligan 0 - 9:  Basic Linux commands (cd, ls, cat, less, man, grep, awk)
Hooligan 10 - 19: Digging a bit deeper (hardware information, disks, the nitty gritty)
Hooligan 20 - 29: Getting funky, encryption, compression, cron, finding a needle in a haystack
Hooligan 30 - 35: ???
